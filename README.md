Gamma Shower Classification using Cherenkov Telescope Simulation

Simulated atmospheric Cherenkov gamma-ray detection using Monte Carlo-generated particle showers.

Extracted Hillas parameters by applying PCA to shower images captured on a photomultiplier camera plane.

Engineered features such as asymmetry, elongation, and spatial extent to distinguish gamma events from cosmic-ray backgrounds.

Explored statistical discrimination techniques for gamma/hadron separation based on shower geometry and energy deposition.
